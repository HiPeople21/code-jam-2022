# Sensational Sirens - CodeJam 2022

# Development

## Code style
Please see [the Black code style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html) for the code style that we will be following.

The CI should automatically format your code to conform to the Black code style, so this should not be a problem or anything that you have to spend too much time on.

## Pull requests
Your pull requests will be squashed upon merge. This means that if a pull request contains more than one commit, it will be "squashed" into one commit.

Please keep Pull Requests focused on one feature.

Please refrain from committing directly to the main branch.

Before being merged, Pull Requests will require approval via a Pull Request review. Feel free to review other people's Pull Requests.

## Testing
All code, where possible, should be tested. Ask Sam if you need any help with this.
